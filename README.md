### Build dependencies ###
* Java Development Kit
* Android SDK
* Android Studio
 * Android Studio is not really needed but is the recommended way to hack on simlar-android.

### Compile (Console) ###
Linux/MacOS
```
export ANDROID_HOME=<YOUR ANDROID SDK DIRECTORY>
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Build without Google Services
```
./gradlew assembleAlwaysOnlineRelease -Pno-google-services
```

Compile and run static code analysis.
```
./gradlew build connectedCheck
```

### Android Studio ###
Initially importing simlar-android in Android Studio, removes the inspection settings. That's why we recommend to run the following command once after importing:
```
git checkout .idea/
```

### linphone-sdk ###
Simlar heavily depends on the [linphone-sdk](http://www.linphone.org/) formally known as liblinphone.
Since version 4.2 Belledonne publishes it in a maven repository.
However if you would like to compile it yourself, you should start with compiling the [linphone-sdk](https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/linphone-sdk) for android.
Once it compiles on your system, here is a script for checking out, compile and integrate the linphone-sdk into simlar-android.
```
./scripts/bootstrap-liblinphone.sh origin/master
```
The linphone-sdk uses cmake. You may set its environment variables e.g. to compile with multiple threads.
```
CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=32 ./scripts/bootstrap-liblinphone.sh
```
